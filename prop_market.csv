The layout comprises: an open plan kitchen/living/dining area with a front patio, a main bedroom with an en suite, another double bedroom and a main bathroom. Optional garages are available at an additional price. Project location: Mellieha is a village located in the northwest part of Malta with its name originating from the Ancient Roman salt-terms 'Melh'. The small town of Mellieha (pronounced mell-ee-ha) perches picturesquely atop the ridge between St Paul's Bay and Mellieha Bay (Ghadira Bay for the locals). The village is a popular resort, but at the same time it has not been overdeveloped due to its distance from the hustle and bustle, the town has a laid-back, local feel. There are numerous large hotels in Mellieha, however, it retains a certain elegance, and it is a home to some excellent restaurants. A 15-minute walk from the new development leads down the steep hill to Mellieha Bay, probably the most popular sandy beach in the Maltese Islands famous for its white sands and clear water. Further away is Armier Bay that is yet another sandy bay with a lovely view of Comino and Gozo. During the summer months, the population increases significantly due to many Maltese having summer residences in Mellieha and the tourists coming over to enjoy their holidays. All year around, the inhabitants are around 7,250 people in an area of 22.6 km2. The charm and mystique in the region where this new development is located are alluring. Overlooking Mellieha and Manikata with picturesque landscapes on the coastal region, the views are second to none, with many trails leading to spectacular vista points. Truly a destination for all seasons with spring trails for adventurous walkers, summer with drenched beaches, autumn full of breathtaking sunsets and winter of fantastic dinners with local fresh produce ingredients from the local farmers. The new development will incorporate an array of apartments being sold finished to high standards including bathrooms and internal doors. The apartments in the development have a possibility to be incorporated with the hotel for the service of both short- and long-term letting. The project will incorporate among other things an internal heated pool that can be transformed into an outdoor space in the heated seasons, a complete spa & sauna, a shopping complex, restaurants and cafes plus a Zen garden in the heart of the project. The project, mainly the buy-to-let apartments, will revolve around the hotel that the project incorporates, making the letting more profitable when amalgamated with the hotel bookings. The residents of the project will have a privileged access to all amenities on a day-to-day basis making the most out of the location and the site facilities.Ref: SAPT8173 Size: 92sqm Bathrooms: 2",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
